# CryptoCoder: Implementation of Cryptography Methods for Message Encoding and Decoding


## INTRODUCTION

In order to secure communication against unauthorized access or eavesdropping, a procedure known as cryptography converts data into an incomprehensible format called ciphertext. Data confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are all ensured with this crucial tool in information security.
Providing secure communication in the presence of adversaries is cryptography's main objective. It uses several mathematical approaches and algorithms to Encrypt in which it is the transformation of plaintext into ciphertext, and decryption is the process of doing the opposite. Using a single shared secret key for both encryption and decryption, we developed the project using the symmetric key. 
The sender and the recipient will both encrypt and decode the message using the same key.
The project is a GUI-based design in which it involves developing visual user interfaces for websites and software programs that allow users to interact with the system using graphical elements including windows, menus, buttons, and icons. The purpose of GUI design is to improve the user experience by making the user interface intuitive, aesthetically pleasing, and simple to traverse.


## DESCRIPTION 	

Since the project is a GUI-based design this cannot be downloaded for installation even so it can be downloaded and extract.


## How to use:
- To use the application, you need an internet connection then Download the zip file and extract it.
-	Once you finish downloading and extracting the file, open it in PyCharm or VScode.
-	After that you need to install the needed imports to access the file.

-	Run the file

-	Once you run the file try to input the symmetric key

-	Then select or create a txt file to from your computer or laptop to encrypt

-	After encryption, save the encrypted file
-	Upload the encrypted txt file to decrypt it again

## Method:

The method use was Caesar Cipher (Monoalphabetic Substitution) in symmetric algorithm which uses a substitution method where the letters in the alphabet are shifted by the given secret key to yield an encoding alphabet.
